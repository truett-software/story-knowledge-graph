but my goal is to augment and automate human decisions by training computers to process machine readable instructions, present advice and make decisions

let's look at the wine and cheese pairing

step 1
classify cheese (using WEDGE-client)
specifically Italian Cheese

now let's classify wine
French wine ontology
The below links use a third-party processor to read our machine-language ontology and reder it in human-readable form
a table (RDFa)
https://redefer.rhizomik.net/rdf2html?rdf=https://afdsi-ontology.s3.amazonaws.com/wine-france.rdf&mode=html&namespaces=true&language=en
a graph (rendered as an SVG)
https://rdf2svg.redefer.rhizomik.net/render?url=https%3A%2F%2Fafdsi-ontology.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fwine-france.rdf


now a pairing application
  wine and cheese

Here's an example
using Italian Cheese, look for
  Taleggio

now, using the Wine Cheese pairing app, search for
  Taleggio
