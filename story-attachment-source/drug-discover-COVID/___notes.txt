COVID story

We all know about COVID and the coronavirus.

Spike protein is one of the major structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.
It enables interaction of the virons with host cell receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral envelop with host cell membrane to allow infection.

Research using this Knowledge Graph is summarized here:

* According to the results, the Spike peptide peptides SQCVNLTTRTQLPPAYTNSFTRGVY is predicted to have the highest binding affinity to the B-Cells.

* The Spike peptide FTISVTTEI has the highest binding affinity to the MHC I HLA-B1503 allele.

* The Nucleocapsid peptides KTFPPTEPK and RWYFYYLGTGPEAGL have the highest binding affinity to the MHC I HLA-A0202 allele and the three MHC II alleles HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*02:01, HLA-DQA1*01:02/DQB1-*06:02, HLA-DRB1, respectively.

* Furthermore, those peptides were predicted as non-toxic and non-allergen.

* Therefore, the combination of those peptides is predicted to stimulate better immunological responses with respectable safety.

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid discovery of a safe and effective vaccine is an essential issue, consequently, this study aims to predict potential COVID-19 peptide-based vaccine utilizing
  the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N)
  and Spike Glycoprotein (S)
  via the Immunoinformatics approach.
