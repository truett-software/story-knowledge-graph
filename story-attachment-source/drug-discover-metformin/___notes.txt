Objectives
Drug repurposing, which finds new indications for existing drugs, has received great attention recently.
The goal of our work is to assess the feasibility of using electronic health records (EHRs) and automated informatics methods to efficiently validate a recent drug repurposing association of metformin with reduced cancer mortality.
